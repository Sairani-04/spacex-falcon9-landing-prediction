SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

Predicting Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings using real SpaceX launch data.

Successful landings dramatically reduce launch costs.
This project analyzes historical launch data to identify the factors that influence landing success and builds machine learning models to predict outcomes.
