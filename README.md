## Project Highlights
- End-to-end data science workflow
- Real-world aerospace dataset
- Predictive modeling with interpretable insights

---

## What I Did
- Collected launch data via the SpaceX API and Wikipedia web scraping
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL and visualizations
- Built interactive maps and dashboards
- Trained machine learning models to predict landing success
