SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project predicts whether the Falcon 9 first-stage booster will successfully land after launch. Since successful landings significantly reduce launch costs, this analysis helps understand the key factors behind mission success.

As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera), I worked on the complete data science pipeline:

Collected launch data using the SpaceX API and Wikipedia web scraping

Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis

Performed EDA using SQL and visualizations

Built interactive maps and dashboards

Trained machine learning models to predict landing success

Tools & Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL, Plotly, Folium, Dash
